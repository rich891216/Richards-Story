There was a man called Richard who is from California and went to school in UW-Madison. 
After seeing startups like Facebook and Tesla become billion dollar companies, he decided he wanted 
to become a CS major and start the next big thing.

Richard came to Madison hoping to become a billionare but alas all he found was infinite winter. For
Wisconsinites, once the weather is mid 30's and sunny that is spring for us however Richard could not
believe his eyes. He saw people walking around with shorts while snow was still on the ground. He 
thought all of these people were very weird but realized he was the only one not wearing shorts, and
decided it was time to embrace the cold.

Richard was finally ready to face the cold. Kitted out with a Canada Goose Parka, hat, and gloves, he was
ready. Then all of sudden, one weekend, the weather got super nice. Gone were the subzero degree days and 
blistering cold wins. Here come the sunny 50 degree beautiful spring weather.

This beautiful day encouraged Richard to study outside and so he did. Later that day, while he was doing his work
under a tree on Bascom Hill, a brilliant idea came to him for a startup. He was going to start a company to change the
world. He was so excited, that he dropped out of school to pursue his dream.
